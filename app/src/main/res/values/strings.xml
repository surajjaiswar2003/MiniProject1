Separate an intact section about the size of a soup can and break it apart with your fingers. Determine whether the soil is cloddy, powdery, or granular. Ideally, your soil should be made up of different sized crumbs that will hold their shape under slight pressure. Crumbs, or aggregates, as soil scientists call them, that break apart only with difficulty mean your soil is too hard. Soil that\'s easy to work allows water to reach roots efficiently and is less prone to compaction.</string>

Once you\'ve reached root depth, pull an annual plant up and check the extent of root development, searching for fine strands with a white healthy appearance. Brown, mushy roots indicate serious drainage problems—and a poor outlook for this year\'s harvest. Stunted roots might also indicate disease or the presence of root-gnawing pests. Roots have the most immediate connection with and reliance on soil quality. Without air, water, biological activity, and crumbly soil to grow in, roots can\'t do their job.</string>

Dig a hole 1 foot square and 1 foot deep, set the soil aside on a tarp or in a bucket \n\na. fill the new hole with water, and allow to drain. \n\n2. Immediately refill the hole with water and measure the depth of the water with a ruler. \n\n3. 15 minutes later, measure the drop in water in inches. Multiply the number by 4 to calculate how much water drains in an hour \n\na. The ideal soil drainage is around 2” per hour, with readings between 1”- 3” generally OK for garden plants that have average drainage needs. \n\nb. If the rate is less than 1” per hour, your drainage is too slow, and you’ll need to improve drainage or choose plants tolerant of wet soil. \n\nc. If drainage is more than 4” per hour, it’s too fast, and you should consider choosing plants that tolerate dry conditions and droughty soils. \n\n*Drainage problems can be addressed following these tips:* \n\n\t1. Incorporate compost and organic matter into the soil. Organic matter helps heavy clay soil to drain and helps coarse sandy soil to hold moisture, so it’s a win-win no matter what your soil type! \n\t2. Choose plants suited to your soil drainage. \n\n\t3. Build raised beds for better control over the soil texture.</string>

Compare the color of water to the adjacent color scale, which indicates the pH. \n\n‣ Soil test kit ₹300-₹1000: Same as the pH tester, only it adds three extra containers and capsules to measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. (Note: no need to test for nitrogen because it moves in and out of soil so quickly that testing would be meaningless).</string>

Add distilled water to the other container until the soil is muddy. \n\n5. Add 1/2 cup baking soda. If it fizzes you have acidic soil, most likely with a pH between 5 and 6. \n\n6.

If you count less than 10, your soil does not have enough active players in the food chain. \n\nA thriving population of diverse fungi, bacteria, insects, and invertebrates is one of the most visible signs of soil quality. The more that creeps and crawls under your garden, the less opportunity there is for pests and disease.
